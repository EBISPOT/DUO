# DUO - governance process

Authors: Melanie Courtot, Moran cabili, Laura Paglione

Date : 11/29/2018

Status : Draft v2. First round of comments done. To undergo final approval.



*   Changes and modifications to DUO should be use cases driven. Requests should include a concise description of the use case and datasets to which the changes/new terms would apply, as well as contact details for a representative of the project requesting the change.
*   Changes and requests are to be publicly posted on our [GH tracker](https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO/issues)
*   We will attribute via ORCID contributions of the community, such as annotation properties at the term level referring to the submitter etc
*   Contribution from the global scientific community (in addition to and beyond GA4GH) are welcome
*   Proposed changes when they affect existing terms in the DUO will be communicated on the DU mailing-list, inviting feedback and comments at least 2 weeks in advance.
*   We will make efforts to directly engage with specific groups when we know they have a stake in a specific aspect of DUO. However, this is not always possible and interested parties should subscribe to [GH notifications](https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO) and [mailing-lists](https://groups.google.com/a/ga4gh.org/d/forum/duri) to keep informed of latest developments and discussions.
*   The DUO governance committee (DUO GC) reviews and votes on proposed changes. The GC aims at providing feedback within 2 weeks.
*   The DUO GC:
    *   Is composed of the DU chairs and representatives of driver projects. It is expected that membership will rotate. Initial rotation will be staggered over several years to prevent global turn-over at once.
    *   Nominations will be invited on a yearly basis (including re appointment of current GC members). This includes self-nominations. Eligibility for the GC is based on being part of the DURI group or a GA4GH driver project. If there are more nominations than open spaces the GC will vote to determine new members.
    *   The DUO GC comprises an odd number of at least 5 members. 
    *   Decisions are made by majority consensus of the elected members (e.g.,  If the GC comprises 5 members, a consensus will be reached when 3 consistent votes are received). 
*   Initial membership will include the DU chairs and representative of groups that are **actively consuming** DUO (e.g., they have an implementation that references DUO terms).
